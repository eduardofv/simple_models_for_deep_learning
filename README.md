# Simple Models for Deep Learning Testing

A simplified test for wide and deep networks using Tensorflow. Check [blog post](http://eduardofv.com/2016/08/04/simple-models-for-deep-learning/) for details and Jupyter notebook for the code.

See the [markdown version of the Jupyter notebook](models_for_deep_learning/models_for_deep_learning.md) in case of any problem.
